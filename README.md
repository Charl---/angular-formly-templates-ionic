# Angular-Formly: Ionic Framework Templates

This is a shell repository for templates for [ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) for [angular-formly](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly). Would love for someone to implement this! If you're interested, ping us on [Issue #1](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-templates-ionic/issues/1)
